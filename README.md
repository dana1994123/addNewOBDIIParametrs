# Adding New Parameters to OBD-II Collection for Electric Vehicles

The "addNewParameters.ipynb" IPython notebook focuses on enhancing the OBD-II parameter collection by incorporating additional non-standard parameters specifically tailored to electric vehicles (EVs). These parameters have been meticulously identified through thorough research and are seamlessly integrated into the OBD-II parameter collection for comprehensive data logging and analysis.

## Introduction

As the automotive landscape evolves towards electric vehicles, capturing an exhaustive set of parameters is crucial for gaining insights into EV-specific performance, diagnostics, and user experience. The "addNewParameters.ipynb" notebook is dedicated to expanding the OBD-II parameter collection to accommodate non-standard parameters unique to electric vehicles.

## Identifying New EV-Specific Parameters

Informed by extensive research in the field of electric vehicles, this notebook identifies a selection of non-standard parameters that provide valuable insights into various facets of EV operation. These parameters delve into aspects such as battery health, state of charge, charging efficiency, regenerative braking effectiveness, power distribution, and more. Each parameter is meticulously chosen based on its relevance to understanding and optimizing the performance of electric vehicles.

## CSV File Creation: Structured Parameter Details

To facilitate seamless integration, the identified non-standard parameters are compiled into a structured CSV file. This file includes a comprehensive set of fields for each parameter, such as its name, description, units, data type, and relevance to electric vehicle performance. This CSV file serves as a consolidated reference for adding the new parameters to the OBD-II parameter collection.

## Integration with OBD-II Parameter Collection

The notebook guides users through the process of integrating the newly identified non-standard parameters into the existing OBD-II parameter collection. Each parameter's details, as outlined in the CSV file, are systematically extracted and added to the collection. By doing so, the parameter collection is extended to capture the complete range of data points needed to comprehensively analyze and optimize electric vehicle performance.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the "addNewParameters.ipynb" notebook using Jupyter or a compatible environment.
2. Execute the notebook cells in sequential order to observe the seamless integration of new EV-specific parameters into the OBD-II parameter collection.
3. The notebook reads parameter details from the prepared CSV file and incorporates them into the collection, enhancing the collection's coverage of electric vehicle attributes.
4. Examine the updated parameter collection to ensure the successful integration of the newly added parameters.
